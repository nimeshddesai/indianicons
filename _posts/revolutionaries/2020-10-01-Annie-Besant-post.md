Annie Besant was born in London on 1 October 1847. At 19, she married Frank Besant, but their differing views on religion led to their separation. Annie became a writer and speaker, championing freedom of thought, women’s rights, secularism, and the rights of workers. Her pamphlet on birth control caused her arrest, but she was later released. A member of the Fabian Society, Annie supported workers’ movements for better conditions.

She became interested in Theosophy, focusing on ideas of karma and reincarnation, and moved to India in 1893. In India, she worked to improve education and humanitarian causes while joining the Indian Independence movement. In 1917, Annie was arrested for protesting British rule but released after massive public protests. That same year, she became the first woman President of the Indian National Congress.

__Trivia__ : *In 1916, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak founded the Indian Home Rule League to advocate for self-rule.*
