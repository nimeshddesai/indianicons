Swami Vivekananda was born as Narendra Nath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, coinciding with the festival of Makar Sankranti. He graduated from Calcutta University, gaining extensive knowledge in Western philosophy and history, as well as ancient Hindu scriptures. His spiritual quest led him to Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where they formed a unique guru-disciple relationship. Despite his family's poverty, Narendra devotedly served his guru, caring for him during his throat cancer.

After Ramakrishna's death, Narendra and fifteen other disciples lived together in Baranagar, North Calcutta. Narendra Nath took the monastic name Swami Vivekananda and set out to spread his guru's teachings, traveling on foot across India. During his travels, he witnessed widespread poverty and suffering. While meditating on a rock at the southernmost point of Kanyakumari, he attained enlightenment and realized that India needed to awaken from centuries of oppression.

Hearing about the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, Vivekananda sailed to America on May 31, 1893, with the help of funds. Despite initial struggles, he attended the Parliament, where his speech in September 1893 touched hearts and made him famous worldwide. He spent the next three and a half years spreading Vedanta and Ramakrishna's teachings in the USA and Europe.

Upon returning to India in 1897, Swamiji delivered lectures across the country, instilling pride in India's cultural heritage. He founded the Ramakrishna Mission and Belur Math, which, besides promoting Vedanta, engaged in social services like establishing schools, colleges, and hospitals. Swami Vivekananda's life inspired many, some of whom joined the Ramakrishna Math to dedicate their lives to helping others.

__Trivia__ - *Swami Vivekananda’s birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day in India.*
