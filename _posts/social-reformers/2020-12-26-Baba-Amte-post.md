Murlidhar Devidas Amte, fondly known as Baba Amte, was born on 26 December 1914 in Hinganghat, Maharashtra. He came from a wealthy family, enjoying a luxurious life in his early years, but everything changed when he decided to dedicate his life to helping others. Influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Sane Guruji, Baba joined the Indian freedom movement and gave up his comfortable lifestyle, adopting Khadi and simple living.

Baba Amte’s life took a new direction when he encountered a severely affected leprosy patient. At a time when leprosy patients were shunned by society, he decided to fight for their dignity and treatment. In 1949, he founded *Anandwan (Garden of Joy)*, a rehabilitation center for leprosy patients, inaugurated by Vinoba Bhave. Over time, his organization, Maharogi Sewa Samiti (MSS), expanded to help countless people in need. Baba also worked for tribal rights, leading campaigns like the Bharat Jodo Abhiyan to promote unity.

Baba Amte is often called the last true follower of Gandhi. For his extraordinary social work, he received numerous awards, including the Padma Vibhushan in 1986.

__Trivia__ : *Mahatma Gandhi nicknamed Baba Amte Abhay Sadhak (Fearless Seeker of Truth) for rescuing a girl from British soldiers.*
