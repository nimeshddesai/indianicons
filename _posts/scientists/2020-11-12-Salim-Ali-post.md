Salim Moizuddin Abdul Ali, born on 12 November 1896 in Mumbai, became one of the greatest ornithologists and naturalists of all time. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by his maternal uncle. Ali initially studied zoology at St. Xavier’s College in Bombay but left midway to manage his family business in Burma. He had a lifelong fascination with birds, which began in his childhood.

After returning to India, Salim Ali worked as a guide lecturer at the natural history section of the Prince of Wales Museum in Bombay. Later, he trained under the famous ornithologist Professor Erwin Stresemann at the Berlin Zoological Museum in Germany. On his return, while working as a clerk, he gained international recognition for his research on the breeding habits of baya birds.

For nearly 80 years, Salim Ali meticulously observed and documented the birds of India. He conducted systematic bird surveys across the country and wrote numerous books that made ornithology popular in India. His famous book, The Book of Indian Birds, is a landmark in Indian ornithology. Alongside the renowned ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley, he co-authored the 10-volume Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan. J.B.S. Haldane once praised Ali’s ability to conduct meaningful research with just binoculars in hand.

Ali was also a strong advocate for nature conservation and contributed to efforts to protect India’s wildlife. His fascination with motorcycles and adventurous spirit further set him apart. Many bird species, sanctuaries, and institutions are named in his honor, including the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary in Goa. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1976 for his contributions.

__Trivia__ : *Salim Ali is fondly known as the “Birdman of India.”*
