Prafulla Chandra Ray, known as P C Ray, was born on 2 August 1861 in Raruli-Katipara, Bengal Presidency. As a child, he had to pause his studies due to a severe illness, which he used to read extensively. In 1882, Ray won a scholarship to study at Edinburgh University, where he was mentored by renowned chemist Alexander Crum Brown.

After returning to India, Ray became a professor at Presidency College, teaching future luminaries like Meghnad Saha and Satyendra Nath Bose. In 1896, he invented a new chemical compound, mercurous nitrite, which paved the way for over 100 research papers by him and his students. In 1901, Ray founded Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Ltd, India’s first pharmaceutical company, which still operates today as BCPL. He also started factories for pottery, soaps, and canning.

Ray published The History of Hindu Chemistry in two volumes, showcasing ancient India’s advancements in metallurgy and medicine. Fondly called “Acharya” by his students, Ray was also a social reformer known for his simple lifestyle. His autobiography is titled *Life and Experiences of a Bengali Chemist*.

__Trivia__ : *P C Ray is remembered as the Father of Indian Chemistry.*
