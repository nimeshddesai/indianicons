Major Dhyan Chand was born on August 29, 1905, in Allahabad. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest field hockey players in history. His father, a hockey player himself, served in the British Indian Army, which meant frequent relocations for the family. This disrupted Dhyan Chand's education during his childhood.

Following in his father's footsteps, Dhyan Chand joined the army at the age of 16, where he began playing hockey. He often practiced at night under the moonlight after his duty hours. Representing the army in various hockey tournaments, his exceptional skills quickly garnered attention.

When field hockey was reintroduced at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, Dhyan Chand was selected for the Indian team. He became a national hero after India won the gold medal, thanks in large part to his extraordinary goal-scoring ability. Known as 'The Wizard' or 'The Magician' of hockey for his superb ball control, he captained India to victory in the next two Olympics, securing consecutive gold medals.

Major Dhyan Chand's international career spanned from 1926 to 1949. In recognition of his contributions to sports, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian honor, in 1956. In 2021, India's highest sporting honor, the Khel Ratna, was renamed after Major Dhyan Chand.

__Trivia__ : *Major Dhyan Chand's birthday is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year*.
