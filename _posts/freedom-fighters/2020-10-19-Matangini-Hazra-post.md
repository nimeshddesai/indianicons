Matangini Hazra was born in the small town of Hogla, near Tamluk, in Bengal. Some accounts say her birthdate was 17 November 1869. Due to poor economic conditions, she didn’t receive formal education and was married at a young age. Sadly, she became a widow by the age of 18. After that, she dedicated her life to serving the nation and its people.

Matangini was deeply inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement. She helped the poor and spun her own khadi (handwoven cloth). In 1932, she was arrested for breaking the Salt Act, and again later for protesting against a local tax. When the Quit India movement began in 1942, 73-year-old Matangini led a march of 6,000 people—mostly women—to take over the Tamluk police station and demand independence for the town. As the police tried to stop them, Matangini bravely stepped forward to ask the police not to shoot. Despite her plea, she was shot three times. Even as she was wounded, she held the Indian flag high and continued chanting “Vande Mataram” until she died. Matangini Hazra was lovingly called “Gandhi buri,” meaning “Old Lady Gandhi” in Bengali.

__Trivia__ : *In 1977, a statue of her was placed at the spot where she was killed, making it the first statue of a woman in Kolkata.*
