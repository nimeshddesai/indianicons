Sarojini Naidu, born as Sarojini Chattopadhyaya on February 13, 1879, in Hyderabad, began her literary journey at the age of 12, earning international praise for her play. She received a scholarship from the Nizam and went to London for higher studies. Sarojini became an incredible poet of the 20th century, expressing her feelings, emotions, and experiences through her poems.

Passionate about women's education, she made numerous speeches on its importance. She considered Gopal Krishna Gokhale her guru and joined the Indian freedom movement in 1905. In 1911, she received the Kaiser-i-Hind award from the British government for her flood relief work. In 1917, Sarojini established the Women's Indian Association and led its delegation demanding voting rights for women.

In 1925, she became the first woman president of the Indian National Congress. Sarojini actively participated in the non-cooperation movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi and led women satyagrahis during the Salt March in 1930. During the Quit India movement, she was jailed at the Aga Khan Palace alongside Gandhiji. After independence, Sarojini Naidu became the first woman governor of India, serving as the governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Awadh from 1947 to 1949.
