Aruna Asaf Ali was born as Aruna Ganguly on July 16, 1909, in Kalka, Haryana. In 1928, she married Congress leader and barrister Asaf Ali, which marked the beginning of her active involvement in Mahatma Gandhi’s freedom movement. She was imprisoned for her participation in the Salt Satyagraha.

On August 8, 1942, the Indian National Congress launched the Quit India Movement at a session in Bombay. When all senior leaders were immediately arrested, Aruna stepped up to preside over the remainder of the session on August 9, where she famously unfurled the flag of Indian Independence at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. This act sparked nationwide protests despite the absence of senior leadership.

Aruna went underground after this event and continued to support the movement through radio broadcasts, magazines, and pamphlets. After India gained independence, she remained active in politics for some time. In recognition of her exceptional revolutionary spirit and her efforts to improve the lives of women and the poor, she was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1997.

__Trivia__ : *Aruna Asaf Ali became the first elected Mayor of Delhi in 1958.*
