Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, fondly called Rajaji, was born on 10 December 1878 in Thorapalli village, Tamil Nadu. After studying law at Presidency College in Madras, he started practicing in Salem in 1900 and became the chairperson of the Salem municipality in 1917. He founded the Tamil Scientific Terms Society to make scientific concepts more accessible by translating complex terms into simple Tamil.

Rajaji was a close friend of V.O. Chidambaram Pillai, the founder of the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company. In 1919, he joined the fight against the oppressive Rowlatt Act and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement. He played an active role in movements against untouchability, such as the Vaikom Satyagraha, and led the Salt Satyagraha at Vedaranyam in the Madras Presidency. In 1937, Rajaji became the first Premier of the Madras Presidency, where he introduced alcohol prohibition and opened temples to Dalits.

Though he opposed the Quit India Movement during World War II, he advocated for dialogue between Gandhi and Jinnah, proposing the famous C.R. Formula to resolve tensions between Hindus and Muslims. After independence, he served as Governor of West Bengal and later became India’s first and only Indian Governor-General, a position he held until 1950. Rajaji also served as Home Minister and Chief Minister of Madras State, advocating policies against China’s expansionist stance and opposing the linguistic division of states. For his wisdom and foresight, He was often called The Wisest Man In India.

In 1958, he left the Congress Party and founded the Swatantra Party, which became a major opposition party. Rajaji was a prolific writer in Tamil and English, authoring books such as Chakravarthi Thirumagan, a retelling of the Ramayana, for which he received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958. He was also one of the founders of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, promoting Indian education and culture. For his immense contributions, he was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1955.

__Trivia__ : *Rajaji was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958 for his Tamil retelling of the Ramayana, Chakravarthi Thirumagan.*
