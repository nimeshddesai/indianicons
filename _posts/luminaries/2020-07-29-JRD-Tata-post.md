Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, commonly known as JRD Tata, was born on July 29, 1904, in Paris. JRD was one of India’s greatest industrialists and aviation pioneers. His father was a business partner and relative of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. JRD entered the Tata business as an unpaid apprentice in December 1925 and rose to become one of its youngest Chairmen in 1938. Over the next 50 years, he expanded the Tata Group into chemicals, automobiles, tea, and information technology sectors.

JRD had a deep passion for flying and became one of the first Indians to gain a commercial pilot's license in 1929. In 1932, he established Tata Air Mail, which he later rebranded as Tata Airlines, India's first domestic carrier. After nationalization, Tata Airlines became Air India.

JRD was a vocal supporter of economic liberalization long before it was implemented in India. He also advocated for population control and helped in family planning initiatives. Under his guidance, several institutes like the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and Tata Memorial Hospital were established to promote science, medicine, and the arts. In 1992, JRD received India’s highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna.

__Trivia__ : *JRD Tata was the pilot of the first flight in Indian aviation history, flying from Karachi to Mumbai on October 17, 1932.*
