Captain Anuj Nayyar was born on August 28, 1975, in Delhi. After graduating from the National Defence Academy (NDA), he was commissioned into the 17th Battalion of the Jat Regiment in June 1997. During the Kargil War in 1999, Captain Nayyar was deployed in Jammu & Kashmir along the Line of Control (LoC). 

One of the strategic locations, Peak 4875, also known as Pimple Complex, was infiltrated by Pakistani forces. Capturing this peak was crucial for taking control of Tiger Hill. On July 7, 1999, Captain Nayyar's Charlie Company was tasked with capturing Peak 4875 without any aerial support. During the challenging climb, the enemy intensified their attack, bombarding them with mortar and automatic fire. The commanding officer was injured, splitting the company into two groups, one led by Captain Anuj Nayyar and the other by Captain Vikram Batra.

Under Captain Nayyar’s leadership, his company successfully cleared three of the four enemy bunkers and began the assault on the final one. Captain Nayyar was hit by an enemy rocket-propelled grenade while clearing the fourth bunker. Despite his injuries, the company managed to clear the last bunker, but none of the soldiers from Captain Nayyar's team survived the battle. Peak 4875 was later attacked again by infiltrators, but this time it was successfully defended by Captain Batra's team.

__Trivia__ : *At the young age of 23, Captain Anuj Nayyar displayed extreme courage and grit in the face of the enemy and was awarded Maha Vir Chakra.*
