Bana Singh was born on 6 January 1949 in a tiny village of Kadyal near Jammu. At the age of 19, he joined the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI). In 1987, Pakistan forces successfully occupied a key peak in the Siachen glacier within Indian territory at 21,153 feet and named it Quaid Post. The Indian army made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the post in May 1987 under the patrolling unit. It resulted in the death of 10 Indian soldiers including the unit leader Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande.

 To avenge their killing and to get back the post, another attack was planned and was given the name Operation Rajiv. Naib Subedar Bana Singh did not figure in the selected team but Col Rai, who was Commanding Officer of Sonam Post, handpicked him for the task. What resulted was one of the most challenging military operations anywhere in the world, climbing 1500 feet ice walls in -40 degrees temperature and 50 kmph wind in a climate very similar to that of Mount Everest. After initial failed attempts due to extreme climate, Bana Singh led his men through an extremely difficult and hazardous route on 26 June 1987. They crawled to reach the post and then threw hand grenades into the enemy bunker. Bana Singh showed exemplary courage and charged towards the enemy bunker, killing those inside as well as those patrolling outside. His bravery inspired others and they captured the post. 
 
 Naib Subedar Bana Singh was awarded the Param Veer Chakra for conspicuous bravery and leadership under the most adverse conditions. The unit also received one Maha Vir Chakra, seven Vir Chakras and one Sena Medal for the Operation Rajiv. Bana Singh was subsequently promoted to the honorary rank of Captain. Hon Captain Bana Singh retired from service on 31 October 2000.

__Trivia__ : *To honour the bravery of Bana Singh, the post he captured is now called Bana Post (Bana Top)*.
