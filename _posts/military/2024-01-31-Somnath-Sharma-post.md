Major Somnath Sharma was born on January 31, 1923, in Dadh village, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. Coming from a family of military officers, he attended Sherwood College in Nainital before joining the Royal Military Academy. On February 22, 1942, he was commissioned into the 8th Battalion of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment, which later became the 4 Kumaon Regiment of the British Indian Army.

During World War II, Major Sharma fought in the Arakan Campaign under the British Indian Army. On October 31, 1947, his company was airlifted to Srinagar amid rising tensions in Kashmir. Despite having a broken hand, Major Sharma insisted on joining the mission.

Intelligence reports suggested that Pakistani forces might attack Badgam from Gulmarg to cut off Srinagar airport. Major Sharma’s D Company of 4 Kumaon was deployed in Badgam. On the afternoon of November 3, 1947, over 700 Pathan raiders, who had blended in with the local population, attacked the Indian army from three sides. Outnumbered seven to one and under heavy fire, Major Sharma understood the crucial need to hold their position to save Srinagar. 

With his left hand in a plaster cast, he filled magazines and issued them to soldiers operating light machine guns. Moving from post to post, he motivated his men to fight bravely, disregarding his own safety. For five hours, they fought relentlessly, even as ammunition ran low. A mortar shell eventually exploded near Major Sharma, causing fatal injuries. By the time relief arrived, the post had been lost, but the damage inflicted by his unit had halted the raiders, allowing the Indian army to recapture Badgam. Major Somnath Sharma's actions were instrumental in preventing the fall of Srinagar and possibly all of Kashmir.

__Trivia__ : *At 25 years old, Major Somnath Sharma became the first recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honor.*
