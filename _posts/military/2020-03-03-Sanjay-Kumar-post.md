Sanjay Kumar was born on March 3, 1976, in Kalol village of Bilaspur district in Himachal Pradesh. After completing matriculation from a local school, he joined the 13th Battalion of Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (JAK RIF). During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan had captured Point 4875, a strategic location overlooking the valley and National Highway 1D, the lifeline of Kargil and Leh. The 13 JAK RIF was tasked with recapturing this point in the Mushkoh Valley.

On the night of July 4, 1999, the battalion launched its operation, climbing the steep hill under the cover of darkness. Then 23-year-old Rifleman Sanjay Kumar, along with Najinder Singh, was the leading scout. When they were just 150 meters from the enemy position, they faced intense fire from two machine guns, halting their progress. Recognizing the critical situation, Sanjay Kumar charged the enemy bunker, disregarding his personal safety. Despite having bandages on both arms, he silenced the machine guns and killed three enemy soldiers in the first bunker through hand-to-hand combat. He then advanced to the second bunker, forcing the enemy to flee. 

Even though he was profusely bleeding from his wounds, Sanjay Kumar refused evacuation and continued to motivate his unit. His extraordinary bravery inspired his comrades, and they successfully recaptured the area known as Flat Top from the enemy. For his unmatched courage, determination, and selfless spirit, Sanjay Kumar was awarded India's highest military honor, the Param Vir Chakra. Naib Subedar Sanjay Kumar now serves as a weapon-training instructor at the prestigious Indian Military Academy in Dehradun, proudly wearing the most coveted medal of the Indian armed forces.

__Trivia__ : *Before joining the Indian Army, Sanjay Kumar worked as a taxi driver in New Delhi.*
