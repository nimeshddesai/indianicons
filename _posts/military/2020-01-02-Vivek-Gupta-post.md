Major Vivek Gupta was born on January 2, 1970, in Dehradun. Inspired by his father, Col BRS Gupta, an Army Ordnance Corps officer, and the many stories of army valor he heard in his childhood, he aspired to join the army. At just 22 years old, he graduated from the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun as a 2nd Lieutenant on June 13, 1992, and was commissioned into the Rajputana Rifles Regiment.

During his service in Jammu & Kashmir, Major Gupta was awarded the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) commendation for killing a Pakistani terrorist in hand-to-hand combat. He also served as a weapon instructor at the Infantry School in Mhow.

During the Kargil War in 1999, the 2nd Rajputana Rifles was tasked with capturing Point 4590 of the crucial Tololing Top. On June 13, 1999, Major Gupta led the Charlie Company in the assault. His inspiring leadership ensured the company's progress despite heavy artillery fire. When the attack was temporarily halted due to multidirectional fire as they emerged into the open, Major Gupta took immediate action. He fired a rocket launcher at the enemy position and, despite being hit, charged ahead. Engaging in severe hand-to-hand combat, he killed three enemy soldiers and reached the top. His bravery inspired the rest of the company, who surged ahead and captured the enemy position. Tragically, Major Gupta succumbed to his injuries on the battlefield. For his act of exemplary bravery, an exhibition of spectacular courage and supreme sacrifice, he was given the nationâ€™s second highest gallantry award, *Maha Vir Chakra* posthumously.

__Trivia__ : *Major Vivek Gupta was martyred on the same day he had joined the Rajputana Rifles, seven years earlier.*
