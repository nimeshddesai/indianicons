Yogendra Singh Yadav was born on May 10, 1980, in Aurangabad Ahir village near Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh. At just 16 years old, he joined the Indian Army. During the Kargil War in 1999, he served as part of the Ghatak platoon of the 18 Grenadiers.

On the early morning of July 4, 1999, his unit was assigned the mission to capture three strategic bunkers on Tiger Hill. Yadav led the assault, scaling a vertical, snow-capped cliff in the dead of night. His group of seven men became isolated from the rest of the unit and found themselves outnumbered by enemy soldiers.

Yadav witnessed the loss of all his comrades and suffered 12 bullet wounds himself. Unable to walk and barely able to see, he heroically killed several enemy soldiers and managed to drag himself back to his unit. Despite his injuries, he provided crucial information about enemy positions, enabling the 18 Grenadiers to successfully capture Tiger Hill.

It took years for Yadav to fully recover from his injuries. He continued to serve in the army as a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) and was later promoted to the rank of Subedar Major. On the occasion of the 75th Independence Day, Yogendra Singh Yadav was conferred the rank of Honorary Captain by the President of India.

__Trivia__ : *Yogendra Singh Yadav received the Param Vir Chakra at the age of 19, making him the youngest recipient of the award.*
