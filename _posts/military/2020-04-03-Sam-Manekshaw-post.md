Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, fondly known as Sam Bahadur, was born on 3 April 1914 in Amritsar. He graduated from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in 1934 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Indian Army. During World War II, he fought bravely in Burma. After partition, his unit, the 12 Frontier Force Regiment, went to Pakistan. Manekshaw decided to stay with the Indian Army and was reassigned to the 16 Punjab Regiment.

Manekshaw’s remarkable career saw him rise to Brigadier and become the first Indian Director of Military Operations. As the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern Command, he successfully handled insurgency in Nagaland. On 7 June 1969, Manekshaw became the 8th chief of Army Staff. As Chief of Army Staff, he led India to a historic victory in the 1971 war, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh. Over four decades, he served in five wars and earned great respect for his leadership. For his exceptional service, he received the Padma Vibhushan in 1972. In 1973, he became the first Indian officer to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal.

__Trivia__ : *Sam Manekshaw accompanied V P Menon to Srinagar when the Instrument of Accession was signed by Maharaja Hari Singh in 1947.*
