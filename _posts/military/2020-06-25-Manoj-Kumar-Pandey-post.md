Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey was born in Rudha village of Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh. During his school days, he had a keen interest in boxing and bodybuilding. Determined to win the Param Vir Chakra for his country, he joined the National Defence Academy. After completing his training at the NDA, he was commissioned into the 1/11 Gorkha Rifles of the Indian Army.

His moment of valor came during the Kargil War in July 1999. On the night of July 2/3, Captain Pandey led a company tasked with capturing Jubar Top of Khalubar Hills in the Batalik Sector of Kargil. Under intense enemy fire, he quickly moved his platoon to an advantageous position. With fearless determination, he charged ahead, clearing the first two enemy bunkers.

Despite being hit on the shoulder and legs while clearing the third bunker, Captain Pandey continued his assault. He destroyed the fourth bunker with a grenade, even though he was gravely injured. A bullet hit him in the forehead, and he collapsed. His bravery and sacrifice enabled the Indian Army to eventually capture Khalubar.

For his extraordinary courage and leadership, Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honor.

__Trivia__ : *Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey did win the country's highest gallantry award, Param Vir Chakra, but unfortunately did not live to receive it in person.*
