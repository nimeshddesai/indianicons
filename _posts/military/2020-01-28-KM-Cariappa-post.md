Field Marshal Kodandera Madappa Cariappa was born on January 28, 1899, in Coorg. He was one of the first Indians selected for the batch of King’s Commissioned Indian Officers at Daly Cadet College, Indore. Receiving his permanent commission in 1922, he was initially posted to Mesopotamia (Iraq) and later transferred to the Rajput Regiment upon returning to India. In 1933, Cariappa became the first Indian officer to attend the Staff College in Quetta. 

During World War II, he became the first Indian to command a unit in 1942, seeing action in Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Burma. In 1947, he was the first Indian selected for a training course at the Imperial Defence College in Camberley, UK. During the partition of India, Cariappa oversaw the division of the army and its assets. He served as the Eastern Army Commander and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command during the war with Pakistan, successfully leading Indian forces to recapture Zojila, Drass, and Kargil.

On January 15, 1949, Cariappa became the first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. After retiring in 1953, he served as India’s High Commissioner to Australia and New Zealand. He was honored with the ‘Order of the Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit’ by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. In 1986, the Government of India conferred upon him the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

__Trivia__ : *Field Marshal Cariappa became Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army on January 15, which is now celebrated as Army Day in India.*
