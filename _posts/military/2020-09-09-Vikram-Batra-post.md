Captain Vikram Batra was born on September 9, 1974, in the Palampur district of Himachal Pradesh. As a young boy, he watched the TV series "Param Vir Chakra" and discussed the heroic stories with his twin brother. Fearless and determined, Vikram Batra was commissioned into the 13 Jammu and Kashmir (JAK) Rifles in 1996.

During the Kargil War, Batra's Delta Company and Bravo Company, led by Lt. Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, were tasked with capturing Point 5140 in a daring night attack. Batra led his team up a tricky slope, launching a surprise attack. His courage and leadership inspired his men, and they successfully captured Point 5140.

The next objective was Point 4875. Delta Company began their assault on the night of July 6, 1999, but were delayed due to an officer's injury. Undeterred, Captain Batra decided to attack in daylight, catching the enemy by surprise. Despite being injured, he continued to lead the charge. Tragically, Batra fell while trying to evacuate one of his soldiers, but his sacrifice ensured his company's success.

For his exceptional bravery, leadership, and supreme sacrifice, Captain Vikram Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.

__Trivia__ : *Captain Vikram Batra's signal after capturing Point 5140, "Yeh Dil Maange More," became a famous catchphrase during the Kargil War.*
