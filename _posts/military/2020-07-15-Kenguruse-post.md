Captain Neikezhakuo Kenguruse, fondly known as *Neibu*, was born on 15 July 1974 in Nerhema village, Kohima district, Nagaland. He grew up in a large family with ten siblings and completed his schooling in Jalukie village, where his father worked as a pastor. While attending Kohima Science College, Neibu worked as a teacher to support his family. His ambition to uplift his family led him to clear the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam and join the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun. On 12 December 1998, he was commissioned into the Army Service Corps (ASC) and attached to the 2nd Rajputana Rifles.

Barely six months into the Indian Army, Captain Kenguruse, affectionately called 'Nimbu Saab' by his unit, found himself in the midst of the Kargil War. He led the Ghatak Platoon of his battalion in the Drass sector. After successfully capturing Tololing Hill on June 13, his unit was tasked with capturing Lone Hill. On the freezing night of 28 June 1999, the operation began. The path was perilous, involving climbing a nearly vertical cliff under enemy fire. Despite intense mortar fire causing heavy casualties, Neibu led his team with remarkable courage.

Faced with a slippery rock wall, Neibu removed his shoes for better grip and climbed barefoot. He destroyed the first enemy bunker with a rocket launcher, but was hit in the abdomen. Undeterred, he continued leading his team, killing two more soldiers before a bullet threw him off the cliff, resulting in a 200-foot fall. His bravery inspired his troops to successfully capture the enemy position and complete the mission. Captain Kenguruse's sacrifice brought the youth of the conflict-ridden Naga region closer to the Indian Army.

__Trivia__ : *Captain Neikezhakuo Kenguruse is the only officer from the Army Service Corps (ASC) to be awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.*
