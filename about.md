India is a land of stories. There are stories in every state and every region of this country. We all know a lot of movie heroes, cricketers, even politicians. Anyone can easily name 10 of them.

But what if we ask you to name 10 scientists or revolutionaries or heroes from our armed forces?

There are many people who helped shape India over many centuries. There are names whose life can provide so much inspiration but are hardly known or forgotten in the layers of history.

*What if these names are introduced again as small stories, will they create genuine interest?*

The purpose of this blog is to provide an interesting and encouraging introduction about few such Indian heroes. Once readers get to know about the hero, they can explore them in greater details through various books and other resources.

These heroes are from different fields, including but not limited to, revolutionaries, freedom fighters, statesmen, scientists, armed forces, social workers and arts. Over the time, Indian heroes from different fields will be introduced here.

Over the next 100 days, we'll be adding one or more stories daily. Do check those out and share with your friends.
